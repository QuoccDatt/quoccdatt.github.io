## Overview

After successfully deploying the Lambda Function and API Gateway, you will use the **Postman** tool to test the core features of the personal note-taking system.

Through Postman, you can send HTTP requests (such as `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to the API Gateway to interact with the note system.
