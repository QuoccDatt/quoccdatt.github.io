## Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to deploy a **personal note-taking system** using a **serverless architecture on the AWS platform**.

The application allows users to create, edit, view, and delete personal notes through APIs implemented with AWS Lambda and data managed by DynamoDB. Users can interact with the system using Postman or other HTTP client tools. The entire infrastructure is serverless, helping reduce costs and enabling easy scalability.
