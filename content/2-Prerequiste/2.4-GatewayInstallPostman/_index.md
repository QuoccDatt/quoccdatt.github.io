### API Testing with Postman

After installation, you can start testing the endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint       | Function          |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| POST   | `/notes`      | Create new note    |
| GET    | `/notes/{id}` | Get note by ID     |
| PUT    | `/notes/{id}` | Update note        |
| DELETE | `/notes/{id}` | Delete note        |

**Important notes:**
- Add header `Content-Type: application/json`
- For APIs requiring authentication, add `x-api-key` header with API Key from API Gateway

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can save requests as Collections for later reuse
